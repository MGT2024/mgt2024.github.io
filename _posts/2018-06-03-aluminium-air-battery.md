## A single charge on an electric car manage to travel 1,770 kilometers, where as Tesla Model S can only travel up to 482 kilometers ##

Aluminium-air battery is lighter than lithium-ion battery, and that is the reason the car can travel fursther. This technology is created by an Israeli company, partnered with aluminium specialist Alocoa Canada. They make this technology afordable by manufacturing in Canada, where hydro-electricity is common. This technology is use to assist the lithium battery, which is tested in Citroen C1 powered by lithium battery that can only travel few dozen miles (Anthony, 2013). 

### What is it made of? ###
This technology is made with aluminium plates. 

### How it works? ###

This technology uses oxygen, which is part of the air, to fill its cathode. It turn the metal into aluminium hydroxide, which can be used again to make new battery. Car owner would have to swap batteries every few months. Tesla showed their battery swap service only requires 90-seconds. To maintain this reaction, car owners would just have to add tap water every few months (Edwards, 2014).

### Conclusion ###
The cost of this technology required is around $25. This technology can give the car another 1609 kilometer, with the price it is definitely worth and affordable. But will it be primary source or just a range extender for the car?
