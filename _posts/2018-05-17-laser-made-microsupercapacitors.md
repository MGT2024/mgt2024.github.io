## Microsupercapacitors are not batteries but they can store energy. Traditional capacitors stores energy and release it quickly like camera flash##

Researcher in Rice University discovered a technology that charges **50 times** faster and discharge slower than traditional capacitors. This technology shows a long life and stable even though is bent **10,000 times** ("Scientists see the light on microsupercapacitors: Laser-induced graphene makes simple, powerful energy storage possible", 2015).

#### "**It's a pain in the neck to build microsupercapacitors now, They require a lot of lithographic steps. But these we can make in minutes: We burn the patterns, add electrolyte and cover them.**" ####  
##### -James Tour, Rice University Chemist #####

This technology is manufactured using commercial laster, burning electrode patterns on the plastic sheets which remove everything except few atoms thickness of carbon segment from the top layer. And this is the graphene, they called it laser-included graphene (LIG). Then the LIG sheets is treated with variety of chemicals and altered some of the graphene into positive and negative electrodes, and the two sheet types combined into a capacitors (Andrews, 2015).

#### Conclusion ###
This is a new discovery to store energy. Although it is not a type of battery, but the function is similar to battery, a energy storage systems. The problem of this technology is that our devices and car are still using batteries instead of capacitors. James Tour is convinced that supercapacitors will replace batteries in the future.
