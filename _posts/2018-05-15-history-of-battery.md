## Battery is like an energy storing system. It stores energy and convert into electric, which is a essential for city. ##

Today batteries come in different range of sizes, guarantee of supplying electric from a tiny batteries for electronic watches to the scale of village or island.

The graph above shows the market revenue in USD billion unit of types of battery from year 2013 to forecast of year 2024. From year 2013 to 2017, the total revenue for lithium ion and lead acid rose high. This is because lithium ion is mainly use on gadgets while lead acid battery is mainly use in car.

### History ###  
<span style= "font-size:30px;"> 1800 </span> Voltaic Pile. Alessandro Volta, a Italian physicist seperates stacked of copper and zinc discs with cloth and soaked into salty water. Wires are connected to one of the end. Each of the copper and zinc disc could produce 0.76 Volts, the more set of the disc would produce more volts.

<span style= "font-size:30px;"> 1980 </span> Lithium-ion batteries, a more compact, higher capacity, safe and rechargeable batteries invented by Professor John Goodenough. The lithium could migrate through the battery from one electrode to another as Li+ ion. Can store 150 watt-hours per kilogram (Brain, n.d.).
